# Congrats!

> Now you know how to navigate into a Unix system!
> 
> It’s time to test and decide what will be your favorite text editor on your sandbox:  **Emacs**  or  **Vi**.
> 
> During this project you will play with  **Emacs**.

## **Resources**

# Requirements

> -   All tasks  **must be**  done inside the sandbox  `Ubuntu 20.04`
> -   Your sandbox  **must be available at the end of this project**  - the Checker will access to it at midnight for running the correction!
> -   The answer of a task must be in a specific file
> -   Each answer file must contain only the command to execute in Emacs for solving the task. Example: “What is the command to write buffer to a specified file?” -> the file should contain only  `C-x C-w`
